Hey All, 

ipLine is the variable

Example.txt is the file from which data is read by the server

WALL must come before WIND/DOOR as there is no way to determine position without at least one wall's length.
values of WIND/DOOR are in distance from edge. Negative values are not acceptable.

when bot program finished must end with ENDPROGRAM.

data.txt will be wiped when ClientMachine runs, it's starting contents are irrelevant.

IF YOU NEED ANYTHING FEEL FREE TO TEXT/CALL ME.
-Jo
